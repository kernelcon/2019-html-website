                      Do you live with your head in a cloud? Do you fear small things? Is your mastery of virtualization and IAAS to the point where you haven't seen a real computer in months? Do you (most importantly) feel an unexplainable compulsion to open anti-static baggies handed to you by (almost) strangers and tinker with the contents therein? If so, have we got a workshop, nay, a way of life for you! In the Build Your Own Microcontroller Multi-Tool workshop, you and a handful of your newest and coolest friends will get to construct an ESP32 microcontroller-based device that you can take home! While constructing the device, we will discuss and tinker with each component to see what makes it tick. Then we'll boot things up and (provided the blue smoke hasn't escaped by this point) write some code, interface with sensors to measure the environment, tap into common communications buses for fun and profit, mess with wireless communications, and maybe even lose some time playing a video game.

                      Hands-on exercises utilizing OT networks are used to develop the skill objectives of the course, including the fundamentals of triage, network hunting, and active defense in OT networks. Teamwork, communication, and proper application of these skills are required to pass the final exercise, where students must work together to identify and stop an active sabotage attack against an OT network. Students gain real-world experience in the fundamentals of BCS incident response on BACnet-based systemsand networks.

Whether you‚Äôre just starting out professionally in security, or looking to change things up the Kernelcon resume clinic is the perfect place to get constructive, honest advice on your resume and interviewing skills. First, experienced recruitment volunteers will review your resume and give you constructive feedback on how to get beyond corporate filters and non-technical reviewers.  Next, a brief one-on-one interview with an experienced security hiring manager will give you a sandbox for testing your interviewing techniques.  After the interview, the hiring manager will discuss with you the details of your resume, skills, and interview and including areas to focus on for improvement. The Kernelcon resume clinic is a pressure-free environment, and your information won‚Äôt be given to any of the recruiters involved unless you provide it.  The clinic is free for attendees, but space is limited and slots will be filled on a first-come first-serve basis. Talent & Employers, Kernelcon is happy to provide job hiring/seeking bracelets.  If you‚Äôre looking to hire some of the best hackers in the area, or you are scoping out new opportunities grab a bracelet from the registration table.  Spark up a conversation with others who have the bracelet and see where it takes you.
