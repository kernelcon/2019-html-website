                      <div class="abstract">The traditional approach to software security testing typically involves some form of human interaction. It is accompanied by long wait times, and large, overwhelming scan results. This hardly lives up to the automation hype of the DevOps culture. With the traditional model, follow-up remediation typically includes lengthy conversations with security engineers to a back-and-forth fix and retest cycle. This process is often an afterthought towards the end of the SDLC when code fix costs are extremely high and deployment schedules are tight. The traditional approach does not scale in today's software engineering demands. DevOps, 12 Factor apps, quick agile iterations, and aggressive deployment schedules require security to operate at a new speed; the speed of DevSecOps. How many product owners have had to hit the pause button on rollout in order to complete a full SAST or DAST of the entire world before going live? Traditional find/fix and repeat methods are being upstaged by more streamlined solutions that integrate directly into the developer's native workflow allowing a real-world shift-left. This includes allowing the developer to interact with SAST/DAST/IAST/Open Source Monitoring from their development workspace, and also in the Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline. Advanced DevSecOps implementations facilitate agility, early fixes, open source visibility, and developer-centric tooling the gives dev teams much more control over secure coding models. The Scalable Agile Framework (SAFe) provides a culture where the DevSecOps toolings and processes thrive.</div>

My approach strives to highlight the temporal and mechanical connections that exist between higher-level behaviors and regions of the code base/binary by instrumenting, tracing, and analyzing all memory writes with respect to the software’s current execution path. This technique allows us to develop and test our understanding of the relationships between code and objects (data structures and/or regions of memory). I will discuss how these tools and techniques can be used to identify and distinguish between different phases of U-Boot execution (including distinct phases of initialization and relocation) and then show how such information can be used to design a coarse-grained memory region-based access control policy.</div>

Take for example the DSL Modem: one of the most commonly deployed networking devices for home users.  A typical DSL Modem will have one or more RJ45 LAN ports, but testing the WAN port proves problematic: most DSL Modems use RJ14 ports for the WAN!  Enter the DSLAM.  The DSLAM is the head end unit for DSL Modems.  We'll talk about the underlying technologies used in communicating with the head end system (DSLAM) as well as how you can source, setup, and successfully test WAN services on a DSL modem using a DSLAM. We'll also talk about why you might want to do this and what you might find.</div>

                      <div class="abstract">Traditionally, detection has been performed on point anomalies - a log comes in, the log is analyzed, and a decision is made to alert based on that analysis. Similarly, investigations are based on searches over isolated events - an alert fires and you manually try to find related events based on ad-hoc queries. Grapl aims to move beyond individual events as the fundamental abstraction and focus instead on relationships. Logs are parsed into graph representations and merged into a master graph representing all actions occurring across your environments. This approach allows for relationship-based detections (ex: word isn't scary, and bash isn't scary, but word spawning bash is scary) and more efficient, ergonomic investigations. Grapl handles the work of turning logs into subgraphs, orchestrating signatures executing across the graph, and automatically scoping investigations through expansion of the graph. I hope to demonstrate the benefits of a Graph based approach to DFIR, and how Grapl can aid in that approach.</div>

Looking for signals in the initialization of encrypted communication channels is not a new concept. There are many examples of fingerprinting both unencrypted and encrypted protocols such as TLS. However somewhat surprisingly, no open source scalable fingerprinting method has been developed for one of our most common and relied upon encrypted protocols SSH&#8202;—&#8202;an integral component of the internet. Enter, the HASSH. HASSH is a network fingerprinting standard invented within the Detection Cloud team at Salesforce. It can be used to help identify specific Client and Server SSH implementations. These fingerprints can be easily stored, searched and shared in the form of a standard string of summary text, a hassh for the Client and hasshServer for the Server.  Gaining a greater insight into the observable nature of SSH clients and servers opens up a few really interesting possibilities. HASSH can highlight Deceptive implementations, Detect novel exfiltration attempts within the SSH negotiation packets themselves, baseline devices including IOT devices, make a passive assessment of patch levels of SSH servers and clients, and can easily detect anomalous SSH components in highly controlled well understood operational environments. Further to Detection uses, HASSH can also be built into the control pipeline as an active component.</div>

Google has measured US IPv6 adoption at over 35%. Over 25% of the Alexa Top 1000 sites are IPv6-enabled. Chances are good you (and your users) have used IPv6 as well. Was your deployment planned? Did you address common vulnerabilities? Or do you just want to wreak havoc on your local IT guy? Come learn about the state of IPv6 security. All motivations are welcome.</div>

A true understanding of the dark web would be impossible and misleading if it only included the Tor network. In this talk I will expand the field of view to include frameworks such as Freenet, I2P, and OpenBazaar. We’ll take a quick look at the origins and technical underpinnings of these darknets as well as their actors and offerings. I will also discuss the differentiators that set these networks apart from Tor and highlight why they too should be included in modeling our knowledge of the dark web. Audience members will walk away with a fuller understanding of the internet’s hidden corners, the goals of it’s users, and the technologies that help keep them in the dark.</div>

The rest of that story depends on how we choose to understand one another and adjust our communication styles. Listen as two security professionals discuss how they’ve learned to communicate with people on and off the spectrum. George will explain about what he hears when Carla skips from subject to subject, and Carla will talk about listening to George go into detail about subjects he is interested in. In addition, both Carla and George will talk about the importance of diversity on our teams and throughout the information security community.</div>

                      <div class="abstract">'Notes from Underground:  Compromised Credentials' presents several novel use cases for collecting, enriching, and searching so-called dumps of stolen online accounts.  Although there are many commercial offerings and some free search tools, these tend to focus on the obvious use of stolen credentials to notify potential victims to change their account password.  Victim notification is an important use of the data but researchers can also benefit from collecting and analyzing all of the other relevant details such as IP addresses, user handles, password choice, dates, and sometimes information collected by malicious software.  The audience will see tools to parse, enrich, and format stolen data along with multiple ways to index it, search it, and visualize it.  The tools will be made available publicly at the time of the presentation using GitLab.  Although the presenter cannot give away the data in bulk, sources of compromised credentials will be shared.</div>

                      <div class="abstract">Python was designed for rapid development and ease of use which allows for complex tasks to be completed much faster than its counterparts. However, by nature of the language it can be reverse engineered much faster than a compiled language. This limits the language's potential to be used for developing malware and other nefarious tools. We have surveyed current obfuscation and anti-reversing techniques available to harden Python code. We propose that implementing the most advanced and effective obfuscation techniques currently requires too much effort for adversaries at this time, but that situation may rapidly change as frameworks and tools evolve. Our presentation will discuss obfuscation techniques currently seen in the wild and available to adversaries, as well as more advanced techniques that malware analysts should be prepared for in the future.</div>

There are substantial challenges in applying these standards to existing technologies, but adoption of these standards is beginning to be seen as table stakes by the discrete manufacturing and process communities. This talk will discuss a high level overview of the IEC 62443 series of standards, and some of the challenges in applying them to an industrial control environment.

In the past, we have worked on getting users to plug in USB devices to drop malicious documents and executables. While this attack sometimes proves our point, it is the tip of the iceberg that can be done. Enter Social Forensication. This is a two-pronged attack, consisting first of collecting a memory image for offsite offensive forensic analysis, the second being a rogue Wi-Fi access point attack. During this presentation, we will walk through the steps to perform each attack. Since defense is just as (if not more) important as the attack itself, we will also discuss mitigations (technical and procedural) and relevant windows detections for these attacks.</div>

Specifically, how to present a topic that could stir negative emotions, in a way that is non-threatening. I'm a firm believer in presenting penetration testing findings in a way that communicate their urgency without presenting the information using a harsh tone of voice in the writing. This talk will give you, the audience, some useful communication tips on presenting Penetration Testing Findings in a way that doesn't stir negative emotions from the recipient. Tips will include communication styles per personality type, and what I call danger terms, which are words that have a harsh tone when presented in findings, along with alternative words that communicate more effectively.</div>

                      <div class="abstract">With the glaring financial strain put on the video game industry by hackers, they were among the first private-sector industries to truly focus on security and push for keeping attackers out, but in the face of physical access all their provisions, and yours, are razed in the blink of an eye by adversaries with little to no funding for the project. This will contain a brief history of DRM in the video game industry, how those measures have failed, and why they ultimately always will with an inspection of the Nintendo Switch modding community and the devastating capabilities developed there less than 2 years from the launch date.</div>

In this talk, the speaker demonstrates principles of influence and psychology and how black hat hackers use them on their victims. You need to identify and stop them before you, your clients, and your employees under their unfluence. Learn how here.</div>
