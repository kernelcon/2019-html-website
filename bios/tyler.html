              <h3 class='bio-title'>Security Consultant</h3>
              <p class='bio-text'>Tyler is a security professional based in Omaha, Nebraska. His main area of focus is in penetration testing. He loves learning and scripting his way out of a tight spot, which makes this area of security right up his alley. Tyler graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha with a B.S. in Information Assurance in 2014 and has been working in the offensive security roles ever since. Tyler is highly involved with the security community. He has contributed to open source projects, he has spoken at security conferences (DefCon), and he writes/operates the ZonkSec security blog. If Tyler is not banging his head against his monitor, youâ€™ll likely find him in a garage banging his head against a vintage 2-stroke moped or wandering around in the great outdoors.</p>
